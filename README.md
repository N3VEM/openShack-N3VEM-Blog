# openShack Blog by N3VEM

In the vein of setting up to share as much about the on-going creation and design of my hamshack as possible, this repository will enable me to maintain my blog in an open-source fashion in addition to the projects that I do for the shack.

This means that via standard git commits/pull requests, etc. you can:

- offer edits to existing posts
- suggest design changes to the site
- write guest posts
- etc.

The blog is now being generated using the [Jekyll Static Site Generator](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is currently using a theme designed by [Artemsheludko's](https://github.com/artemsheludko/) called [Galada.](https://jekyll-themes.com/galada/)

To start, here's the quick way if you want to edit existing posts or create new guest posts.

## Just the Basics

The files in this repository are used to generate the static pages for the blog.  The blog posts are generate from files written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) that are stored in the '_posts' folder. If you would like to make edits to an existing post, open the corresponding file, and make your edits. Add appropriate comments about the edits you made, create a new branch, and start a pull requests.  I'll review these and merge things in as I see fit.  If you are a git pro, you can feel free to clone the repository, make edits locally, push them up, etc. etc.

If you would like to write a guest post, create a markdown file using one of the existing posts as a template for the naming convention, and for the "front matter" (the stuff in the header.)  Add your file to '_posts' and create a pull request - I'll review/merge/publish as appropriate.  If you post contains pictures, add the picture files to the 'img' folder using the same methods.

### Fancier stuff

If you're a pro with all this stuff, and want to create pull requests for designs, templates, etc. etc. feel free - if you know how to do all that, you probably know more than me anyway, and I look forward to learning what I can from looking at what you create!

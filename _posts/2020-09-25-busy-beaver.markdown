Welcome to another post in my "reprint" series!  As a kick off to the newly updated blog, I wanted to start by republishing some of my most visited posts, but with updated material.  

This "reprint" is actually a very recent one - not long ago I appeared on an episode of the Ham Radio Workbench podcast, so I threw together a quick post as a place to dump some pictures about the various things I talked about in relation to my shack build.  Since that post had a lot of pictures in a gallery format, its much easier for me to just link you right over to the old post on my "legacy" blog.

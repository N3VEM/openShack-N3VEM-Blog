Welcome to another post in my "reprint" series!  As a kick off to the newly updated blog, I wanted to start by republishing some of my most visited posts, but in the new format, and with updated material where it makes sense to do so.  

Enjoy!

#### POTA Logging Tips

<small>First Published 1/25/2019</small>

As anyone who has checked in with me regularly could tell you, I help support the database and website for the Parks on the Air program.  I have really been enjoying this for 2 reasons:

* It gives me a practical application for my freshly printed (the ink might not even be dry yet) Information Systems degree
* It keeps me involved in the hobby, even during times when getting on the air is challenging because of the family commitments involved with having 3 little kids while doing some traveling for work.

In that role, I've gotten a lot of questions about logging, quite often around Park to Park contacts.  If you're into that type of thing, I put together this video to give a high level overview of how it works.  I'll admit I have very little video-editing foo, so consider this informative, if not well polished:-)  If you don't dig taking the 25 minutes to watch it, here's the TL;DW...

* We follow the guidelines of the ADIF format
* We only store "valid" QSOs in the database, that meet the program rules (1 contact per call, per day, per band, per mode, per park)
* Make sure you log yourself the way you announce yourself on the air (i.e. N3VEM, or N3VEM/P etc.) (*ed. and make sure any variants of your callsign that you use are listed in your profile*)
* Make sure you are accurate with time in your log - there is a 15 minute window that the system uses to match park to park contacts
* Best practice is to log the other operators park in a park to park contact.  The system usually finds the matches if you don't, but there is a very specific scenario where it won't, so consider yourself warned if you like to play it loose :-)

Lastly, even though this video is about logging at a macro level, if you are interested in my take on a good logging program to use in the field, [check out my post on hamlog.](/blog/pota-logging-with-hamlog/)

For those of you that have the time to kill, and enjoy an educational video, albeit of questionable quality, here you go!

Welcome to another post in my "reprint" series!  As a kick off to the newly updated blog, I wanted to start by republishing some of my most visited posts, but with updated material.  

This "reprint" is of the first blog post I ever wrote.  It's also one of my most visited, but I suspect that is primarily because its where you land if you want to be able to click through the progress of my shack build in sequential time-order.  Since this post is really the start of a thread, I'll send you right over to the old post from here, so that if you are so inclined you can spend the time clicking through my shack's history.  Enjoy!

#### Welcome

Does the banner above look familar to you?  If so, thank you for being a long-time reader of my blog!  If you head over to the "about page" you can learn why things look different, but if you're mostly interested in just getting to my "old" blog, [you can find it here.][legacyblog]

Don't forget to head to the home page if you haven't already, and poke around a little. I'm slowly working on "re-publishing" the most popular posts from my old blog, alongside my new content. While you're at it, go ahead and subscribe to the mailing list so that you'll be kept up to date while I overhaul things here on the virtual side of the shack!

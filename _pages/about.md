My name is Vance Martin, Amateur Extra callsign N3VEM. I am a thirty something (pushing 40...) husband and father, who happens to love ham radio!  I became aware of the hobby/service as a teenager, when I stumbled on some of my dad's old radio books, and later when I heard hams on the air using an MFJ World Band Shortwave Receiver that I was given as a kit.  I didn't actaully become a ham however, until April of 2014.  I'm a self proclaimed geek, so ham radio and all the electronic fun it implies is right up my alley! 

My ham radio "career" has taken on several distinct phases:

#### The Early Years

When I started in ham radio I was exclusively mobile on HF, VHF, and UHF.  My day job was as a field supervisor in the Fire Alarm service industry, so much of my radio time happened while traveling between customer sites.  I was also actively working on my information systems degree at the same time, so quite a few of my early contacts also took place from the parking lot a Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, in between the end of my work day and when my classes started.

#### The Middle Years

With a job change (same company, different role), came a TON of additional travel.  Luckily I had already been geared up for "portable" based on the equipment I had from the early years.  I started doing a lot of long distance road trips, and a lot of flying with my gear.  If you check out the posts on my legacy blog from that timeframe, you'll find a lot of information about how I planned trips, traveled with my gear, etc.  It was also conveniently during this time that the ARRL held its year-long National Parks on the Air program (NPOTA), which is how I got bitten by the "park" bug.

#### The Recent Years

The trend here is that my participation in Ham Radio changed styles as I had life and job changes.  For the last couple years I've been working exclusively from home now, so I do very little portable operating.  I still consider myself a portable "enabler" however, because with my freshly minted Information System degree I began volunteering as a developer with Parks on the Air.  Helping to build and run a system that makes it possible for others to get the same thrill I got during NPOTA is a blast.  Additionally, with all the newfound home time, I finally made some serious progress on the home station, and I now do most of my operating from a very comfortable shack that I love.

#### The Future

Change is always good!  I love learning new things, and I plan on continuing that.  Right now I'm in the "automation" phase of my ham shack, so as we keep moving forward through time, I'll be sharing more information about the hardward and software dabblings I do to make my shack an integrated system, instead of just a collection of equipment.  I hope you come along for the ride!
